# Module 3: Isaac AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem integration with ROS 2. This module covers advanced perception, training, and navigation for humanoid robots.

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive coverage of:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim fundamentals for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for perception including hardware-accelerated VSLAM and sensor pipelines
- Nav2 for humanoid navigation with path planning concepts for bipedal movement

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI/Robotics students advancing to perception and autonomy, with a focus on humanoid robotics applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with robotics fundamentals
- Access to NVIDIA Isaac Sim (recommended for hands-on exercises)

## Chapters

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Fundamentals](./chapter-1-isaac-sim-fundamentals.md)
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS Perception](./chapter-2-isaac-ros-perception.md)
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-navigation.md)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Create virtual environments with photorealistic rendering using Isaac Sim
- Implement Isaac ROS perception pipelines with hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid navigation accounting for bipedal movement constraints

## Next Steps

Complete all three chapters in this module to gain comprehensive knowledge of the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem:
1. Chapter 1: Master Isaac Sim fundamentals for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. Chapter 2: Implement Isaac ROS perception systems with hardware-accelerated VSLAM
3. Chapter 3: Configure Nav2 for humanoid navigation with path planning for bipedal movement

After completing this module, students will have the foundational knowledge needed to integrate NVIDIA Isaac technologies with ROS 2 for humanoid robotics applications.
