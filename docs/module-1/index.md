# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the ROS2 Humanoid Education series. This module provides comprehensive educational material for AI/CS students learning Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Overview

In this module, you will explore:
- ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid control
- Python-to-ROS integration
- Humanoid robot modeling

## Learning Path

This module is structured in a progressive learning path:

1. [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1) - Understanding the core concepts of ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robotics
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication with Python](./chapter-2) - Creating rclpy nodes and implementing communication patterns
3. [Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./chapter-3) - Understanding URDF structure, links and joints for robot modeling

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of ROS 2 in Physical AI and humanoid robotics contexts
- Create functional rclpy nodes that communicate via topics and services
- Create URDF models with proper link and joint definitions
- Integrate robot models with ROS 2 and simulation environments
