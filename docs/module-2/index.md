# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Robotics Learning Platform! In this module, you'll explore digital twin technology for robotics using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization. This module builds on the ROS 2 foundation from Module 1 and introduces you to advanced simulation techniques used in robotics research and development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo physics simulation environments
- Create realistic physics models for humanoid robots
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs
- Bridge Unity with ROS 2 for high-fidelity visualization
- Design human-robot interaction scenarios in simulated environments

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn to create realistic physics environments for robot simulation
2. **Sensor Simulation** - Understand how to simulate various robot sensors and process their data
3. **High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity** - Explore advanced visualization and human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, mass, friction)
- Familiarity with 3D environments and visualization

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to learn about physics simulation in Gazebo, where you'll set up your first simulated robot environment.

## Summary

Module 2 has provided you with comprehensive knowledge of digital twin technology for robotics using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization. You've learned to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo physics simulation environments
- Create realistic physics models for humanoid robots
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs
- Bridge Unity with ROS 2 for high-fidelity visualization
- Design human-robot interaction scenarios in simulated environments

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you should have a solid understanding of simulation techniques for robotics. Continue to Module 3 to learn about robot control algorithms and advanced navigation techniques that build upon the simulation foundation you've established here.
