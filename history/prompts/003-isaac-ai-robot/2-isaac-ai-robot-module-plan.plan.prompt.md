# isaac-ai-robot-module-plan

## User Input
```
Create a Module 3 section in the Docusaurus docs structure.

Add three .md chapter files covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation.
```

## Response Summary
Completed the planning phase for the Isaac AI Robot Brain module (Module 3) covering NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. Created comprehensive planning artifacts including:

- Implementation plan (plan.md) outlining technical context and project structure
- Research document (research.md) covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 technologies
- Data model (data-model.md) defining content structure and relationships
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for developers
- API contract (isaac-sim-api.yaml) for potential backend services
- Updated agent context (CLAUDE.md) with new technologies

The plan follows the project constitution requirements for accuracy, content integrity, and alignment with official documentation standards.

## Outcome
Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts generated. The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for creating the three chapter files covering Isaac Sim fundamentals, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation. The documentation will follow Docusaurus best practices and serve AI/Robotics students advancing to perception and autonomy.
