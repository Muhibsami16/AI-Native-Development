# isaac-ai-robot-module-spec

## User Input
```
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Target audience:
- AI / Robotics students advancing to perception and autonomy

Focus:
- Advanced perception, training, and navigation for humanoids
- NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem integration with ROS 2

Chapters (Docusaurus .md):

Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim Fundamentals
- Photorealistic simulation
- Synthetic data generation for training

Chapter 2: Isaac ROS for Perception
- Hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Sensor pipelines and localization

Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation
- Path planning concepts
- Navigation for bipedal movement
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive specification for the "Isaac AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)" module targeting AI/Robotics students. The spec includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering Isaac Sim fundamentals, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation
- Functional requirements for educational content delivery and hands-on learning
- Success criteria focused on measurable student outcomes
- Key entities representing the learning modules and technical components
- Edge cases for various failure scenarios

The specification is technology-agnostic, focusing on educational outcomes rather than implementation details, and includes a quality checklist to ensure readiness for the planning phase.

## Outcome
Specification created successfully at specs/003-isaac-ai-robot/spec.md with supporting checklist at specs/003-isaac-ai-robot/checklists/requirements.md. The feature branch 003-isaac-ai-robot has been prepared with all necessary artifacts for proceeding to planning phase.
